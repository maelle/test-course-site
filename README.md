<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of test-course-site is to create a course website with Hugo and hugodown.

Themes

* [Hugo theme learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn)
* [Hugo theme reveal-hugo](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo)

Slides for each section are listed in the menu and opened in a new tab.
They can be printed to PDF using Decktape which I'm showing in this concept but I'm not sure it's useful.

Why use Hugo for both the website and slidedecks, and not, say Hugo+hugodown for pages and xaringan for slides?

* hugodown syntax highlighting
* emojis! `:grin:` works in slides.

Usage, minus the Decktape PDF printing, for [my Rmd blogging course](https://github.com/maelle/rmd-blogging-course).
