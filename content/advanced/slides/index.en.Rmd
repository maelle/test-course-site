To create a reveal-hugo presentation from the `index.md` file of a leaf page bundle, you need to specify the layout manually.

```toml
layout = "bundle"
```

---

Why? By default, reveal-hugo doesn't create pages for single template types (foo.md), only for list template types (_index.md).

---

This technique can also be used to output an HTML file for any section of a presentation, should you need to.
